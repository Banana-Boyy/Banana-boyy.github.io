    I exit my room, anticipating the moment I’m about to experience. I reach for my fridge handle and hear the magnets give way as I pull the handle, peering into the fridge. The moment I open it, a wave of scent pounds against my nose. Some might say this odor is foul, but these ‘people’ haven’t yet been enlightened by the ways of the curds. I reach for the carton, one in each hand. The once unbearable weight is trumped by my adrenaline for this moment. I take off the caps, throwing them on the ground like a drunk throws his empty glass. These caps would not be needed again. My arms raise the cartons over my head with ease, and I prepare for the wave of cold liquid about to cleanse my body. This liquid, this sweet, sweet nectar, is not water, but milk and its even greater offspring, curds. Five months I had waited for this moment, five months for the milk to age properly, five months I had gone without a cleansing.
    As the first drop peeked over the edge, I closed my eyes, a tingling sensation running through my bones. The nectar rushed down my head, splashing off my shoulders, down my arm, and my legs. As the curds bounced off my skin, I felt alive again. I opened my mouth, allowing the milk safe passage down my throat and into my stomach. It reached my tongue, the essence of the gods stroking my tongue. A lemon, any sour candy, paled in comparison to this drink. I felt a curd enter my abode, the place I feel happiest, and it slid down my throat, eased by the waterfall of drink flowing down. I could feel the cartons lighten, moment by moment, until it was all gone. The carpet below me saved the essence for later, and I could feel curds crushed under my feet. I reached for more cartons, and moved them over to the bathtub, ready for the second stage of my cleansing.
    I poured the liquid into the tub and watched as it slowly filled to the brim, curds floating to the top. As I emptied the last carton, I threw it off. What a pitiful way to hold the holy drink that is milk. I eased myself into the tub, not bothering to unclothe. I felt curds burst below me, and I reached the bottom of the tub. To say I felt great would be a grand understatement. I could feel my flesh pruning. It was near impossible to tell when flesh ended, and milk began. I was in heaven.
